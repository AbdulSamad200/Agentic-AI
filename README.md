# Agentic-AI

Welcome to my hands-on journey into the world of Agentic AI!  
This repository is a collection of small demo projects and experiments that showcase how autonomous AI agents can reason, use tools, retain memory, and retrieve knowledge.

If you're exploring LangChain, CrewAI, LangGraph, PhiData, or building multi-agent systems â€” you'll find simple, easy-to-follow examples here that can help you get started.

Feel free to explore the folders and learn from these mini agent builds! ðŸ¤–ðŸ§
