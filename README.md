# Agentic-AI

This repository contains my hands-on experiments and small agent demos while learning about **Agentic AI**.

Each project explores a different capability of autonomous agents using modern frameworks and libraries. These include tool use, reasoning, memory handling, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
